Meeting Notes, November 10th


Interview questions:

struct S{
  int i;
  char c;
} s;

int main(){
  return sizeof(*(&s));
}

What does main() return?

int main(){
  char a = 0; 
  short int b = 0;
  return sizeof(b) == sizeof(a+b);
}

What does main() return?

The answers for both questions are "I don't know" or "It depends" because it depends on what system you are on. The size of an integer can be different depending on the compiler and the computer.

Nate's talk on Web Services

Using Miami's Web Services to create a course checker in Google sheets

1. Create a Google sheet and add some values
2. Go to Tools->Script Editor

First, we are going to create a simple adding function to learn how sheet scripts work
To create a simple adding function, write something like:
function ACM_ADD(x, y){
  return x + y;
}

And save it. 

Click Publish->test as add on -> installed and enabled.
Click "Select Doc" and select your spreadsheet. Click save and then select your sheet and click "Test"

Okay now it's time to make the real function.

To start, type out the function:

function ACM_COURSE_ENROL(crn){
  return UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://ws.muohio.edu/courseSectionV2/201720.json?crn=" + crn).getContentText(); 
  
}

The URL that fetch hits is part of miami's web services that lists the courses for Spring 2017. Type in =ACM_CORUSE_ENROL(82029) (you can use any CRN) into your workbook and test out the script on it using the same steps as above.

This should spit out a bunch of JSON that contains all of the information for that course

Now let's get some useful information out of this. Change your function to look like this:

function ACM_COURSE_ENROL(crn){
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://ws.muohio.edu/courseSectionV2/201720.json?crn=" + crn); 
  var body = response.getContentText();
  var data = JSON.parse(body);
  return data.courseSections[0].enrollmentCountAvailable;
}

This uses Javascript's JSON parsing functions to get specific values from the JSON returned from the URL so that we can find out what is contained in the "enrollmentCountAvailable" field. The number returned now is the number of spots still open in the class. This is a super simple tool you can use to easily keep track of how many spots are left in the classes you want to sign up for. 

This can easily be expanded to create something much more useful that utilizes more of the information available from the web services

Side note, Time Zones are stupid
