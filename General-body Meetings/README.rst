Presentations
=============

**Every Wednesday from 7-8pm in BEN 008.**

Here are the slides we use during our meetings.

Each folder uses pipenv_ to keep track of dependencies.
If a presentation needs a dependency that is not in the standard library,
it should be installed with::

    pipenv install packagename
