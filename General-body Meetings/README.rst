Presentations
=============

**Every Wednesday from 7-8pm in BEN 008.**

Here are the slides we use during our meetings.

Each folder uses pipenv_ to keep track of dependencies.
If a presentation needs a dependency that is not in the standard library,
it should be installed with::

    pipenv install packagename

Older meetings are linked via Git Submodules.
You'll need to run ``make`` in the project root directory in order to view them.
For more details, see `this GitHub post <https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/#joining-a-project-using-submodules>`_
