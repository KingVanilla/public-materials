Real programmers set the universal constants at the start
such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.

.. What are we doing today?

Today we are making an app for Canvas
=====================================

* Using a module called ``canvasapi`` from the University of Central Florida

----

.. What do we need to know in order to do it?

``canvasapi``
=============

Installing:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install canvasapi --user

Requires a Canvas access token

#. Go to Settings
#. "Approved Integrations"
#. "New Access Token"

----

``canvasapi``
=============

The basics

.. code-block:: python

   # Import the Canvas class
   from canvasapi import Canvas

   # Canvas API URL
   api_url = 'https://miamioh.instructure.com/api/v1/'
   # Canvas API key
   api_key = 'p@$$w0rd'

   # Initialize a new Canvas object
   canvas = Canvas(api_url, api_key)

----

Getting courses
===============

.. code-block:: python

   for course in canvas.get_courses():
      print(course)

----

Getting assignments for a given course
======================================

.. code-block:: python

   course = canvas.get_courses()[0]
   for assignment in course.get_assignments():
      print(assignment)

----

The plan
========

.. _miami-acm/public-materials: https://github.com/miami-acm/public-materials

#. Create a program that lists your courses
#. Modify it so it lists the assignments of a course of your choosing
#. Implement another feature of your choice

   * See the API under today's folder in `miami-acm/public-materials`_

Some ideas to get you going
---------------------------

* Get grades for submissions
* Calculate class grade from graded submissions
* Compute statistics on grades
* Let the user choose the course he wants details on
* etc.

----

Conclusion
==========

We made a useful program that interacted with Canvas.

See you next time
