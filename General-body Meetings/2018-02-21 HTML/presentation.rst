Today we're learning HTML
=========================

* HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language"
* Basis for web sites/apps
* Strictly describes content of the web page

----

Hello World
===========

.. code:: html

  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        Hello World!
    </body>
  </html>

----

HTML Elements
==============

Content surrounded by tags ``<tagname>``

* Paragraphs: ``<p>``
* Headings: ``<h1>``, ``<h2>``, ... ``<h6>``
* Bold, italic text: ``<b>``, ``<i>``
* Links: ``<a>``
* Image: ``<img>``
* Lists: ``<ol>``, ``<ul>`` (contains ``<li>``)
* Checkbox: ``<checkbox>``

Should be followed by a closing tag (``</tagname>``)
or be self-closing (``<tagname />``).

----

HTML Element Atributes
======================

``<tagname attribute1="value">``

* Ex: ``<img src="url/to/image.svg">``
* Ex: ``<a href="https://example.com/" >Link text</a>``

----

CSS
===

* Descibes the look of the web page
* Irrespective of content

  }
