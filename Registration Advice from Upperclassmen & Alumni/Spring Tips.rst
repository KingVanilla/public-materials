Spring Semester Tips
====================

    By Kwangju Kim, Class of 2017

This only gives the advice for CSE courses.
For Miami Plan, or other disciplines (PHY, BIO, CHM, ECE, MTH, STA), talk to the designated department advisors.

* CSE 102: TL;DR.
  Just take it as soon as you feel you can.
  Don't push it back.
* CSE 201: Intro to Software Engineering.
  TL;DR.
  The sooner you take, the better you will be.
  Don't push it back.
  If you are SE major, it is prereq for most of software engineering classes.
* ISA 406: Instead of taking this course, try engaging with Agile Launchpad, which *waives* ISA 406 requirement if you are SE major.
  Talk to `Jim Kiper`_ for more information of applying to it.
* CSE 271: Object-oriented Programming.
  If you are a first-year student who has not taken this should take 271 for this coming spring.
* CSE 274: Data Structure.
  This course is the prerequisite of most of the higher level CSE courses.
* CSE 278: Computer Architecture.
  I think they are changing this to different name.
  Required for both.
  You can also take ECE 287 instead of 278.
* CSE 283: Intro to Network.
  Required for CS, elective for SE.
* CSE 211: Software Construction.
  Required for SE, elective for CS.
* CSE 311: Architecture and Design.
  Required for SE, elective for CS.
* CSE 321: Quality Assurance.
  Required for SE, elective for CS.
* CSE 385: Database.
  If you have taken 274, but not have taken 385, consider taking this course next semester.
  Required for both.
* CSE 443: High Performance Computing.
  **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**, if you have taken 381 (Operating System).
  This course teaches you how to program using multi-core microprocessors with multiple threads.
  Elective for CS, required for SE with specific specialization area (check your DAR).
  For those who want to conduct a research in a graduate school or a lab, or get employed by R & D company, this course will help you a lot.
* CSE 451: Web Services.
  The course is taught by `Scott Campbell`_.
  He is a talented teacher especially in the network area.
* CSE 464: Algorithms.
  Required for CS, and SE with specific specialization area (check your DAR).
* CSE 465: Comparative Programming Languages.
  Typically most seniors are taking this course in order to graduate, so if you are second or third year, defer your plan to take 465 in your senior year.
  Still though, there might be a remaining seat for underclass students.
  Talk to `Norm Krumpe`_ for more information.
* CSE 474: Compiler Design.
  **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**, if you have taken 274.

* Miscellaneous: CSE 273 (Optimization Modeling), CSE 387 (Game Engine Design), CSE 467 (Computer and Network Security), CSE 471 (Simulation), CSE 487 (Game Design and Implementation), etc.
