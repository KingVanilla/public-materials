ACM meeting 2-2-2017

1. Interview question
	Given an array of integers, determine which integer is repeated most often in the array. If multiple are repeated the same number of times, return any of them. 
	Extra Challenge: Do this in Linear Time O(n)

Linear time hint: Use a hash table and the distinct values of keys

2. Creating Your Own Personal Website Using GitHub Pages
	
Technologies Used:
	Git
	Github
	Jekyll - Framework that uses html, css, javascript to make simple blog sites. Makes websites that compile into static code. Itâ€™s a good way to make semi-dynamic seeming sites without actually needing a server. This is why we can host it on GitHub pages which only hosts static sites

For a starting point we can download a previously made project. go to jekyllthemes.org/themes/project-pages

pages.github.com has the rest of the steps for learning how to use GitHub to host web projects.
