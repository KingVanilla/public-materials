Meeting notes for September 29th, 2016

Lesson from Matthew: No matter how good your computer is, it's no good if you're an idiot

Git, Github, Open Source Software

- Open source software:
  - software where people can look and see the source code of the software
  - generally free software
  - created by a community of people
  - ex. Linux, openSSH, Chromium Browser, Firefox, Django

- Github and Git
  - free to signup, place to host code
  - employers like to look at it to see your involvement in projects
  - we are going to be creating a fairly simple open source project
  - go to github.com/miami-acm/member-list and click fork
  - now clone the repository by clicking clone, copying the link, and going into a terminal and typing 'git clone *link*'
  - you should now have a local repository on your computer
  - cd into member-list/ and edit the members file
  - type your name in the members file and save it
  - back in the command line, in the member-list folder type git status
    - this will give you some information about the status of the repository
    - it will tell you about files you have modified
  - enter the command 'git add members' this will add the file members to a list of files that is going to be committed
  - a commit is basically a snapshot of a point in time of the project that you can revert back to if you mess up
  - type 'git commit -m "MESSAGE"' replacing message with something along the lines of "add name to member list". this message labels the commit so anyone who reads it knows what has been saved
  - type 'git push' and enter in your username and password, this will push all of your changes to Github
  - now we need to merge everything together with the parent on the miami-acm repository
  - go back to your repository on github. click 'Pull Request'
  - hit 'create pull request' and add some comments to explain what you did
  - click 'Create pull request' and you're all done!

Git is a really powerful tool that everyone should use for any programming project that you do, especially if there's a chance you might use some of it in the future.
